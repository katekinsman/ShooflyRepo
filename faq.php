                    Our farm is an active, outdoor-oriented camp so dressing appropriately is important. Be sure to pack
                    an extra change of clothes and shoes for the week. Depending on the weather outlook for your child's
                    week, don't forget:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extra shoes - rain boots or sandals</li>
                        <li>Extra pants, shorts or a bathing suit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All children have the opportunity to work with and ride horses. For their safety they must bring:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a well fitting helmet (bicycle is okay)</li>
                        <li>sturdy shoes capable of protecting their feet when working with animals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We provide snacks and juice daily, as well as a cookout lunch with lots of choices on Friday.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pack a sack lunch Monday-Thursday.</li>
                        <li>Daily drop off is 9:00am with pick up at 3:00pm. Check in on Mondays begins at 8:45.</li>

            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
                make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
                concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
                Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.</p>

            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>An optional overnight is offered on Thursdays for campers 8 and older. Overnights are offered on a select
                 few weeks of camp, as denoted on the schedule on the register page. Children bring sleeping bags and
                 overnight gear and set up tents around camp to sleep in with their camp friends. There is a lot of extra
                 free time and extra horseback-riding time, followed by a BBQ and skits put on by the counselors and kids. A
                 few counselors sleep under the stars, keeping tabs on children and tents. In the morning,
                 they make breakfast and take down tents while they wait for the other campers to arrive and camp to start.
