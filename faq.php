                    Our farm is an active, outdoor-oriented camp so dressing appropriately is important. Be sure to pack
                    an extra change of clothes and shoes for the week. Depending on the weather outlook for your child's
                    week, don't forget:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extra shoes - rain boots or sandals</li>
                        <li>Extra pants, shorts or a bathing suit</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All children have the opportunity to work with and ride horses. For their safety they must bring:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a well fitting helmet (bicycle is okay)</li>
                        <li>sturdy shoes capable of protecting their feet when working with animals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We provide snacks and juice daily, as well as a cookout lunch with lots of choices on Friday.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pack a sack lunch Monday-Thursday.</li>
                        <li>Daily drop off is 9:00am with pick up at 3:00pm. Check in on Mondays begins at 8:45.</li>

                Bring some rain boots and a rain jacket, and possibly an extra change of clothes!</p>

            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>Children have the opportunity to ride each day of camp. We have experience with reluctant

        <div class="collapsible_w">
            <div class="collapsible">
                <p>We have a wide variety of horses to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels. While we are able to
                make allowances for more advanced riders, this is a children's camp and there are elevated safety
                concerns. To ensure safety for all riders, there are some things that we cannot allow our riders to do.
                Despite this, we will do our best to make the experience fun and challenging for experienced horseback-riders.</p>
