        <p>Our mission is to offer balance for children in today&#39;s technology driven, speed
        based society. We provide an environment for children to re-connect with the joys and satisfaction of the
        natural world. Through hands-on, experience-based interaction children provide order and meaning to
        our shared world.</p>
